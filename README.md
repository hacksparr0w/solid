Solid is a functional state management framework for Python applications.
It's designed around the following core principles:

 - The benefits of immutability in higher-level programming languages mostly
 outweigh the costs and promote predictable and testable design.
 - Side-effects should always be separated from core business logic to allow
 for code modularity and testability. Furthermore, side-effects should be
 executed in a deterministic fashion as they can result in state changes
 themselves.
 - The framework favors functional, reactive, event-driven programming while
 maintaining Pythonic readability and idioms.
